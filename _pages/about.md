I am a 2nd-year PhD student at University College London, working on Causal Inference and Causal Machine Learning. I am fortunately supervised by [Dr Matt Kusner](http://mkusner.github.io) and [Professor Ricardo Silva](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/). 

I am interested in Causal Inference under weak observability conditions, specifically methods applicable to social sciences.

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned a master's degree in Machine Learning from University College London and my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.
