I am a 2nd-year PhD student at the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), working on Causal Inference and Causal Machine Learning. I am supervised by [Dr Matt Kusner](http://mkusner.github.io) and [Professor Ricardo Silva](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/). So far in my PhD, I have also worked extensively with [Professor Arthur Gretton](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/).

I am interested in Causal Inference under weak observability conditions, specifically methods applicable to social sciences.

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned a master's degree in Machine Learning from University College London and my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk).
